                        I am Kelvin Mwenda. A 21 year old passionate young man.I Went to primary school at Kathituni Boarding Primary school in Tharaka Nithi County. This is where I did my KCPE examinations and I got 408 marks. My marks secured me an opportunity at Starehe Boys Center and School in Starehe Constituency. I did my KCSE examination here and I got an A- of 79 points. I thought life was now gonna be good but low and beyond, it was about to get worser. I had to choose my career course for university. I got a chance at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). After a long brain cells killing session, I finally decided to choose Computer Science all with the hope of becoming a hacker one day. This was going to be one of my biggest decision in my life. But as reality always states, all decisions and actions comes with consequences and a price to pay. The long hard trek and series of sleepless nights and mind-cracking sessions ahead were never even an illusion to me. I blame the hacker movies I had watched. All big dreams are not achieved by luck. The perpetrators always go in life searching moments in order to actually learn the art of mastery. #PayingThe Price</p>
